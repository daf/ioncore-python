class NpreservingEngine(Engine):
    """
    A decision engine that maintains N instances of the compensating units.
    
    This engine is reconfigurable, you can give it a new policy during operation
    and it will respect the new policy on the next 'decide' call.  This is
    detailed in Section I below.
    
    You can also supply it with unique configurations to give unique deployable
    units. This is detailed in Section II.
    
    There are some corner cases to consider with unique configurations, these
    are discussed in Section III.
    
    Those unique configurations are also reconfigurable.  The details of this
    are discussed in Section IV.
    
    
    I. Reconfiguration
    ------------------
    
    The typical Npreserving engine configuration would look like this:
    
    'engine_conf':{
       'preserve_n':'4',
       'provisioner_vars':{'exchange_scope':'XYZ',
                           'epuworker_image_id':'ami-XYZ',
                           'broker_ip_address':'w.x.y.z',
                           'pip_package_repo':'http://ooici.net/packages',
                           'git_lcaarch_repo':'http://github.com/ooici/lcaarch.git',
                           'git_lcaarch_branch':'develop',
                           'git_lcaarch_commit':'HEAD'}
    }
    
    The "provisioner_vars" configuration in this is a group of key/values
    that are sent to every single instance.  Nothing is different about any
    of the instance launches via IaaS.  A new compensating VM will get the
    same dynamic information via contextualization that any others did.
    
    If you used this kind of configuration and called "reconfigure" with
    a new "preserve_n" value only, the other "provisioner_vars" values
    will remain.
    
    For example, you can send this as the payload of a reconfigure operation:
    
    {'preserve_n':'3'}
    
    And because the "provisioner_vars" key is not even present, nothing is
    touched from the previous configuration.  If the key was present, the
    ENTIRE set of values would be replaced by the new conf dictionary.
    
    So this is a rule: the ENTIRE tree of key/values in a configuration is
    replaced if the key is present in the top level of the reconfiguration
    message.
    
    The configurations are technically trees, so if it helps, another way of
    putting this rule is: the root node is "engine_conf" and its direct 
    children are replaceable via reconfiguration.  The ENTIRE sub-tree is
    replaced when a child of the root node is replaced.  Nothing else is
    replaceable.
    
    When do the new values take effect?  In this implementation, any unit
    that is already deployed stays deployed.  If new "provisioner_vars" values
    are sent in and the "preserve_n" configuration is the same, nothing will
    change until something fails and it is replaced with a new unit.
    
    If however a new "preserve_n" value is sent in which is higher than the
    previous one, the newest "provisioner_vars" will take effect immediately
    for any of the new units that are launched. 
    
    
    II. Unique Configurations
    -------------------------
    
    There are only two configurations to the engine that we've discussed so far:
    "preserve_n" and "provisioner_vars".
    
    To support unique configurations, a new configuration was added:
    "unique_instances".
    
    The "unique_instances" configuration is a list of unique keys with their
    own bags of attributes.
    
    Here is an example of a configuration to boot two unique instances.
    
    'engine_conf':{
       'preserve_n':'2',
       'provisioner_vars':{'exchange_scope':'XYZ',
                           'epuworker_image_id':'ami-XYZ',
                           'broker_ip_address':'w.x.y.z',
                           'pip_package_repo':'http://ooici.net/packages',
                           'git_lcaarch_repo':'http://github.com/ooici/lcaarch.git',
                           'git_lcaarch_branch':'develop',
                           'git_lcaarch_commit':'HEAD'},
       'unique_instances':{'b2db408e':{'somekey':'some_value'},
                           '1305a3bf':{'somekey':'some_other_value'}}
    }
    

    The "unique_instances" configuration is a list of unique identifiers,
    each with its own dict of key/value pairs.  Here, note that the
    "preserve_n" configuration is 2 and there are two unique instances.
    This engine will always keep two deployable units running.
    
    One labelled internally as "b2db408e" that is booted with the following
    key/value list sent into the launch contextualization:
    
        'exchange_scope':'XYZ',
        'epuworker_image_id':'ami-XYZ',
        'broker_ip_address':'w.x.y.z',
        'pip_package_repo':'http://ooici.net/packages',
        'git_lcaarch_repo':'http://github.com/ooici/lcaarch.git',
        'git_lcaarch_branch':'develop',
        'git_lcaarch_commit':'HEAD',
        'somekey':'some_value'
    
    And another labelled internally as "1305a3bf" that is booted with the
    following key/value list sent into the launch contextualization:
    
        'exchange_scope':'XYZ',
        'epuworker_image_id':'ami-XYZ',
        'broker_ip_address':'w.x.y.z',
        'pip_package_repo':'http://ooici.net/packages',
        'git_lcaarch_repo':'http://github.com/ooici/lcaarch.git',
        'git_lcaarch_branch':'develop',
        'git_lcaarch_commit':'HEAD',
        'somekey':'some_other_value'

    The internal labels "b2db408e" and "1305a3bf" correspond to unique,
    deployed units (with their own identification).  Let's say for example
    we have:
    
        b2db408e: 7265b438-dbea-4de8-8426-ed52c774367f
        1305a3bf: 5a8b2b75-67f7-433d-ad31-fce5510c976b
        
    The "1305a3bf" unit is being fulfilled with the particular instance
    "5a8b2b75-67f7-433d-ad31-fce5510c976b".  Let's say that instance died
    and needed to be replaced, the new instance will have a new, unique
    ID but it will still be tracked as the 1305a3bf unit:
    
        b2db408e: 7265b438-dbea-4de8-8426-ed52c774367f
        1305a3bf: 2efe02f6-df26-40a8-ba40-1c7c62002c06
    
    When that new unit ("2efe02f6-df26-40a8-ba40-1c7c62002c06") is launched,
    the same key/value list previously sent to the other "1305a3bf unit" will
    be sent.  i.e., this compensating unit will be sent the "some_other_value"
    
    
    III. Corner Cases with Unique Configurations
    --------------------------------------------
    
    In the last example, we had "preserve_n" as 2 and two unique instances. 
    What happens when these don't match up?
    
    1.) If you have more instances in "preserve_n" than there are unique 
    instances configured, the excess instances will just be booted with
    the "provisioner_vars" only.
    
    Example:
    
       'preserve_n':'4',
       'unique_instances':{'b2db408e':{'somekey':'some_value'},
                           '1305a3bf':{'somekey':'some_other_value'}}
    
    In that case you will two instances booted with just the "provisioner_vars",
    one instance booted with "somekey:some_value" and a fourth instance booted
    with "somekey:some_other_value"
    
    2.) If you have less instances in "preserve_n" than there are unique
    instances configured, this will be an error and nothing will be changed.
    
    3.) If you have unique instances that are replaced with new data, this
    will cause terminations.  See the next section.

    
    IV. Reconfiguring Unique Configurations
    ---------------------------------------
    
    Finally, a note about reconfigurations that also include unique 
    configurations.  Recall from Section I that new "provisioner_vars"
    configurations don't actually take effect until a new instance is
    booted.  Quoting:
    
        If however a new "preserve_n" value is sent in which is higher than
        the previous one, the newest "provisioner_vars" will take effect
        immediately for any of the new units that are launched. 
    
    The same principle applies to "provisioner_vars" but not the unique
    instance data.
    
    Recall that when reconfiguring you can only replace an entire subtree.
    For example, you can only replace "unique_instances" as a whole.  If
    you have a situation where you had two keys listed in "unique_instances"
    and you reconfigure things with two different KEYS, the old instances
    will be killed and replaced.  But this does not happen if you only replace
    the data that is supposed to be passed to the unique instances.  Some
    examples should make these rules clear.
    
    The "provisioner_vars" are the same for all examples and abstracted out.
    
    Say you start with the following:
    
       'preserve_n':'2',
       'unique_instances':{'b2db408e':{'somekey':'some_value'},
                           '1305a3bf':{'somekey':'some_other_value'}}
                           
    Two instances are launched and after a while you send a reconfigure message
    with the following:
    
       'unique_instances':{'b2db408e':{'somekey':'some_value'},
                           '1305a3bf':{'somekey':'yet_another_value'}}
    
    Nothing happens right away in that case.  You have not changed the instance
    IDs, just the key/value list for "1305a3bf".  If "1305a3bf" were to fail
    and be replaced, it would be started with the "yet_another_value" instead
    of "some_other_value" like last time.
    
    Then you send the following reconfigure message:
    
       'unique_instances':{'b2db408e':{'somekey':'some_value'},
                           'newkey123':{'somekey':'yet_another_value'}}
                           
    In this case, the instance fulfilling the "1305a3bf" role is terminated
    and one fulfilling the "newkey123" role is started with this new value
    "yet_another_value" in the launch contextualization.
    
    But consider the following reconfigure message sent after that:
    
       'unique_instances':{'b2db408e':{'somekey':'some_value'},
                           'newkey456':{'somekey':'yet_another_value'}}
                           
    Notice that "newkey123" has the same list of key/value configurations as
    "newkey456" did.  So in this case there is already an instance running
    that has been started with the exact thing that this will be started with
    (and hence presumably fulfilling the same "role").  But in this case this
    does not matter.  The configuration values are not examined, only the
    new unique instance key is noticed.  The instance started for "newkey123"
    is now terminated and a new one is started.
    
    That would be a superfluous thing to do since there was already an instance
    running booted with the same configuration, but that is what happens in
    this case.  Those examples should make the rules clear: for the unique
    instances, if the IDs are the same, then the unique conf values are only
    sent when a replacement for that ID is needed.  If the ID keys change, 
    then termination actions will occur for anything missing in the new list
    of unique instances and boots will occur for anything new.
