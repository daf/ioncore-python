Prototype and example service using new Cassandra based Store backend.

To make a generic Store service (an ion service that provides the IStore
interface) the choosing and configuring of the backend client must:
    a) accomplished without editing this file 
    b) the client must be triggered to start using a Connect or Listen
    reactor method as exposed through the ion.core.process.process.Process
    class

A specific service definition probably shouldn't be part of a library
